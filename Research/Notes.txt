    Observer Design Pattern?
    Subject = has the commands
    Observers = Bot account

    Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern#Python
    class Observable:
    def __init__(self):
        self._observers = []
    
    def register_observer(self, observer):
        self._observers.append(observer)
    
    def notify_observers(self, *args, **kwargs):
        for observer in self._observers:
            observer.notify(self, *args, **kwargs)

    class Observer:
        def __init__(self, observable):
            observable.register_observer(self)
        
        def notify(self, observable, *args, **kwargs):
            print('Got', args, kwargs, 'From', observable)


        subject = Observable()
        observer = Observer(subject)
        subject.notify_observers('test')
